# Repository name: network-applet

## Repo Description
Customized network applet for Linux Mint Cinnamon.

## What's new?
Well, when GNU/Linux operating system encourages you to alter it, then why not customize it?!

Linux Mint Cinnamon has the classic look and feel of the desktop computers, and it's my favorite OS. I enjoy customizing it. Therefore, I decided to manipulate its network applet to show some more information about nearby wireless connections. So I added connections' encryption technology for my personal preferences, and the signal quality in the form of string right next to the numeric percentage just for making it nicer :p

## What is changed?
Every section that I added is surrounded by an openning and a closing comment blocks. No original or existing code is modified. To find those sections, just search my name _Kamyar_ through the file.

## Installation
* The original applet should be found under '_/usr/share/cinnamon/applets/network@cinnamon.org_'.
* A secure way to install it, would be adding the new sections, surrounded by comment-block, into your own file at the correct line.

_Replacing the file won't break anything._

_You may also __diif__ it against your version to see what is changed._
