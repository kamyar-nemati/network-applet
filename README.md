## Repo Description
Customized network applet for Linux Mint Cinnamon.

## What's new?
well, when GNU/Linux operating system encourages you to alter it, then why not customize it?!

Linux Mint Cinnamon has the classic look and feel of the desktop computers, and it's my favorite OS. I enjoy customizing it. Therefore, I decided to manipulate its network applet to show some more information about nearby wireless connections. So I added connections' encryption technology for my personal preferences, and the signal quality in the form of string right next to the numeric percentage just for making it nicer :p
